# detoX API

</div>

This API serves as the backend for the [detoX browser extension](https://github.com/alliyah95/detoX) designed to address hate speech detection with a particular focus on election-related and politics-related content in the Philippines. It employs a fine-tuned [RoBERTA Tagalog Base model](https://huggingface.co/jcblaise/roberta-tagalog-base), a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model known for its exceptional performance in NLP tasks.

The model was trained using a [combined dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mapsoriano/2016_2022_hate_speech_filipino) from two sources. The first dataset was a [pre-labeled Filipino hate speech dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hate_speech_filipino). The second dataset consisted of newly crawled 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections-related Tweets.

## üîç Endpoints

### `/` (Root endpoint)

-   Used for checking whether the server is running.

    #### Response:

    ```json
    {
        "1": "Server is up and running"
    }
    ```

### `/api/v1/detect`

-   Returns the result of hate speech detection.

    #### Parameter:

    `?content` - the text content used for hate speech classification.

    #### Example:

    ```
    /api/v1/detect?content=hahaha%20basta%20pulangaw%20bobo
    ```

    #### Response:

    ```json
    {
        "result": 1
    }
    ```
